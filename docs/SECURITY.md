# Security Policy
OpenFuryKMS is a software that allows you to activate Windows and Office for free and legally. However, some older versions of this program (FuryKMS, as it was formerly known) are distributed by several websites that have nothing to do with me, the original developer. All those websites contain a modified version of the activator with malware. 
Therefore, unless I announce it here, GitHub is still and will remain the only safe place to download OpenFuryKMS. Please always verify that you are downloading software from this trusted source.

I appreciate your cooperation and your confidence in my software. I commit myself to review all vulnerability reports I receive and respond to them. I will also strive to fix security issues as quickly as possible and to post the necessary updates on GitHub.
